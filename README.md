<h3 align="left">ABOUT:</h3>

###

<p align="left">Welcome to my SQL & Data Visualization projects repository.<br>This is where I share dashboards, queries, and reports built using SQL, Metabase, and other tools as part of my learning journey and real-world problem-solving practice.<br><br>You'll find a variety of data explorations — from raw SQL queries to interactive dashboards — focused on turning complex information into clear and insightful visuals. Most of these projects come from personal initiatives, study challenges, or experiments with public datasets.<br><br>The main goal here is to keep learning, document my process, and connect with others who are passionate about data. Whether you're just starting with SQL or exploring tools like Metabase, I hope you find something valuable or inspiring.<br><br>Feel free to browse, fork, or reach out if you’d like to chat or collaborate.<br>Thanks for stopping by — and happy querying!</p>
